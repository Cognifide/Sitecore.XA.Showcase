        <p style="color: #000000; text-align: justify;">Developed since 2011 SXA is the first-ever Sitecore full life-cycle site development accelerator. Today SXA delivers far more than accelerated site development; it parallelises work streams and empowers content editors to make more advanced changes normally requiring technical support.</p>
        <p style="color: #000000; text-align: justify;">SXA accelerates deployment of responsive websites quickly and cost effectively, minimising reliance on technical skills while improving maintenance of governance standards.</p>
        <p style="color: #000000; text-align: justify;">This tool uniquely separates front-end and back-end development enabling the parallelisation of design, content and development. Experience Accelerator has an extensive library of re-usable themes, templates and over 50 flexible components allowing you to achieve any layout imaginable. As well, SXA features the innovative Creative Exchange which accelerates and simplifies sharing of website design files between development roles and agencies. Experience Accelerator provides 90% of the functionality required to deploy large numbers of websites out of the box.</p>
