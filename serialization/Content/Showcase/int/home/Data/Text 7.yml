        <p style="text-align: center;">Every feature of SXA comes with productivity in mind - it is meant to be an expert tool that enables the delivery of websites quickly with minimum custom development. This, however, might mean something different for different people - that is why SXA defines clearly its&nbsp;target audiences&nbsp;and plans its roadmap with acute awareness of the clients.</p>
