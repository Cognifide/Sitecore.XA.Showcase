        <h1 style="text-align: center;">Sitecore Experience Accelerator</h1>
        <p style="text-align: center;">SXA is a platform and a concept that enables organisations to perform quick delivery of sites, using standardised sets of functionality with minimum-to-no CMS development. For the purpose of achieving this goal, Sitecore Experience Accelerator utilises a number of concepts, like&nbsp;grid systems&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.csszengarden.com/" rel="nofollow">CSS Zen Garden</a>, to allow for easy and consistent styling of pages and ease of design.</p>
        <p style="text-align: center;">Every feature of Experience Accelerator comes with productivity in mind - it is meant to be an expert tool that enables the delivery of websites quickly, with minimum custom development. This, however, might mean something different for different people - that is why SXA clearly defines its&nbsp;target audiences&nbsp;and plans its roadmap with acute awareness of the clients.</p>
