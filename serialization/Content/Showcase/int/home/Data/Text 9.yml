        <p style="text-align: center;">Do not waste your time trying to get familiar with advanced technology, focus only on what's important to your visitors - quality content.<br>
        By allowing the authors to start entering real content into a wireframe environment, built on Sitecore with SXA, your UI and creatives <br>
        can be working with real content, and the project board can constantly be validating the work. For those interested in Content Strategy, <br>
        this might be the tool you have been looking for to facilitate your approach without boxing you in to a particular way of working.</p>
