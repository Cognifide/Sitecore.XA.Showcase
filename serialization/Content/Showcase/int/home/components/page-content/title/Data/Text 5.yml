        <h2>Title with fall back</h2>
        <p>But what if your page does not have a Title field? Don't worry we have a variant for that. This component variant with fall back allows you to define what happens in such a case. In the example presented here the following is happening: if the primary title of the page is not defined then the navigation title is displayed. If this field is also empty the display name is shown and if that fails a custom text message will appear.</p>
