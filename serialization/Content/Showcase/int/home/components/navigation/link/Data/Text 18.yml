      Hint: Text
      Value: "<p>If your webpage needs a link to a document, or to any other asset stored in the Media Library, please take a look at the Media Link component. This dedicated component allows you to display additional file metadata: e.g. longer description, custom image, size of the asset, etc. The better you present your asset, the more likely is your user to follow the link.</p>"
