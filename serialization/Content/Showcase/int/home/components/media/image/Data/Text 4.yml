        <p>In case you need to, you can add multiple image components. Each will be connected to dedicated data source item which can be later reused.</p>
        <p>In the toolbox, you can see there are two different image components. One is marked as reusable while the other is just a regular one. But what is the difference?</p><p><br /></p>

                    <td style="text-align: left;">Allows you to create an image which is available on the particular page only. The data source&nbsp;will be managed for you automatically.</td>
                    <td style="text-align: left;">Allows you to create an image which is available for all pages. The data source will be placed under the global site data source folder.<br />
