        To start the export, simply click on the Export button in the Sitecore Experience Accelerator ribbon bar.<br />
        <br />
        This will bring up a wizard which will allow you to select what you would like to be exported and whether you want it exported as a zip or just as files in a folder.<br />
        <br />
        The package will export all the content on the site. This is necessary to allow UI developer to work with the site and its actual content. However you can set a limit on the file sizes that exported, which prevents huge assets like videos being included in the package.
