        In a word: content. Any changes to the HTML that are made (with the exception of new classes applied to the SXA components) will be ignored on import. <br>
        <br>
        Content entry is a <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=77C07F1FCD1A41209C432E680196D1FC&amp;_z=z">parallel stream of work</a> which is ongoing and managed on the SXA platform. Therefore, the content that is included in the package is a snapshot that can be used for review, but is mainly exported to allow the UI developer to work within a more realistic world than lorem ipsum.<br>
