        <p>From the beginning, the main idea behind SXA was ease of work and to shorten the time to market of Sitecore solutions. Themes are just a perfect example of this approach.</p>
        <p>Instead of working out the whole page layout from the beginning, simply use one of our base themes as a strong foundation and focus only on the important part of your theme - making it unique and beautiful.</p>
        <p>Widths, heights, and margins should no longer be your concern. Think about colors, borders, and composition.</p>
