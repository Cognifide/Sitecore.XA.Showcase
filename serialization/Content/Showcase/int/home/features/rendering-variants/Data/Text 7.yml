        <p>You don't need to search for variants. They will find you when you need them!</p>
        <p>Drag and drop a new component on your page. If it has variants, you will be asked to select one from the drop-down. No worries, if you skip this step, the top one from the list will be used. I'm pretty sure your administrator ordered them in a way that the most popular one is on the top.</p>
