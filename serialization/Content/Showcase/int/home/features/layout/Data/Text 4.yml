        <h4>Step 1</h4>
        <p>If the three initial placeholders are not enough, you should start your design session with inserting some rows. After <a href="~/link.aspx?_id=6054C188ED984183BBD3E129C09E57E5&amp;_z=z">dragging &amp; dropping</a> row splitter the placeholder will be divided into 2 rows.</p>
        <p>Do you want more? Simply keep adding new rows using the first button on the toolbar until you reach the desired number of rows. Should you ever want to get rid of some rows, use the second button to delete the last row.</p>
