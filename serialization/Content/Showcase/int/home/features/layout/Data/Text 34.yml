      Hint: Text
      Value: <p>We didn't stop there though. Our components take the advantage of advanced grid systems capabilities like responsive reordering using the Push and pull functionality. Go ahead and resize the page to see how the components below reorder themselves and the middle one gets pushed to the top once the layout goes mobile. while the side icons go progressively from taking half to full screen as you switch from <b>Desktop</b> to <b>Tabled</b> to <b>Smart Phone</b> breakpoints.</p>
