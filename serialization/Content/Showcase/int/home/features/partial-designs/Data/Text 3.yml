Often one idea will become a structural element used on many different completed layouts.<br />
        <br />
        SXA is built with the same philosophy. "Partials" are quite simply bits of design. Pieces that can be put together to create a completed layout. Pieces that can be reused on different layouts.<br />
        They can even inherit from each other&nbsp;so that you can build increasingly complex designs from a basic set of reusable snippets and manage them all in a clear and concise way.<br />
        <br />
        All of this is done on the platform, with proper workflows and version control!<br /><br />
