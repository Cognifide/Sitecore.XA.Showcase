        <h2>Full width slider</h2>
        <p>A carousel can be added anywhere on the site, though on many websites this component takes centre stage acting as a teaser, presenting and linking to your featured content, be it the latest news, upcoming events, new products - basically anything important to your business and marketing goals.</p>
